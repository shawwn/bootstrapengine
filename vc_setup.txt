============================
I. Graphics Engine Setup

The graphics engine and common libraries are rather simple
to set up.  They have no external dependencies and should
build immediately as is.  The easiest way to begin using the
graphics engine in your own project is to simply add
"Trunk/ProjectBX/Common/Common.vcproj" and
"Trunk/ProjectBX/Graphics/Graphics.vcproj" to your own
visual studio solution.  Make sure you add the paths
'Trunk/ProjectBX/Common' and 'Trunk/ProjectBX/Graphics' to
Visual Studio's C++ include paths.

============================
II. Bootstrap Editor Setup

The editor relies on two specially configured libraries to
compile: wxWidgets and FCollada.  Both of these libraries
can be found in the Libs folder in respective archives.

To setup wxWidgets, do as follows:

1. Extract wxWidgets to where ever you choose, and then
   browse to the folder where you extracted wxWidgets.
   From here on out, this folder will be referred to as
   ($wxWidgets).
2. Open the '($wxWidgets)/build/MSW' folder and open
   "wx.sln".
3. In Visual Studio, add '($wxWidgets)/include' and 
   '($wxWidgets)/include/msvc' to the C++ include paths.
4. In Visual Studio, add '($wxWidgets)/lib/vc_lib' to the
   C++ library paths.
5. Build the project under both the Debug and Release 
   build configurations.
 
To setup FCollada, do as follows:

1. Extract FCollada to where ever you choose, and then
   browse to the folder where you extracted FCollada.
   From here on out, this folder will be referred to as
   ($FCollada).
2. Open the '($FCollada)' folder and open "FCollada.sln".
3. In Visual Studio, add '($FCollada)' and
   '($FCollada)/LibXML/include' to the C++ include paths.
4. In Visual Studio, add '($FCollada)/Output' to the C++
   library paths.
5. Build the project under both the Debug and Release
   build configurations.

At this point, you should be able to build the editor.  To
do so, simply open "engine.sln" in the 'Trunk/ProjectBX'
folder.  See the editor documentation for information on
how to setup and use the editor.

Well, hope that all helps!
